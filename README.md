👋 Hi there! I’m just an ordinary coder, currently learning how to make computers do cool things (and failing a lot). 😅
🚧 My skills are a work in progress – I promise I’ll get better… eventually.
🖥️ Code might break, but my enthusiasm is unbreakable! 💪

🌱 Currently learning: How to not break things and How to make them work when I do
🤔 Ask me about: The best way to Google an error message
📫 How to reach me: xxx

Fun fact: I can break a project with 5 lines of code, but I’ll try my best to fix it with 1000. 😜
